# LEVT-1.0

## Short summary

Levt is a user-to-user travel tipps plattform without the impact of advertisements of big companies. You can create your own travel diaries and share your experience with other users. You can chat about places and ask for tipps for your next journeys.

In the frontend we used Ionic, based on Angular/Typescript. In the backend, first, we used Lumen, a small version of the PHP framework Laravel. Midtime of the project, we realised that we need features like full user registration process which are only available with Laravel, so we decided to upgrade, which was quite easy, done in 4 workdays.

As we were completely new to creating an application from scratch, as well as creating an application in Ionic with Laravel backend, it took some time for us to learn the frameworks and important MUST-DOs. The whole process took one semester, about 2700 hrs as a 5 persons team.

## Completed User Stories and work packages (needs to be completed)

### #10 feature/newJourney: A logged in user wants to upload pictures and texts about his last journey in order to share his experience.

### #70 feature/homepage: A visitor wants to see the most popular journeys on the homepage, in order to get a good first impression of the application and an overview of the current hotspots.
